## About

An all-in-one add-on for receiving P2000 events from the air, filter them as you like and update sensors with detailed information.

## Features

This add-on is based on my standalone project called 'RTL-SDR-P2000Receiver-HA' which had been created to run on a seperate Linux device,  it was rewritten as an Hassio add-on, I left out unneeded code, added MQTT autoconfigure and optimized it.

It comes out of the box with the following features:

 - Standalone P2000 messages receiver using a local RTL-SDR compatible receiver
 - Support for a large number of RTL-SDR dongles models
 - Automatic MQTT sender configuration and device discovery/creation
 - Global text and capcode filter options
 - Unlimited number of sensors and filters (as long as hardware resources can handle it)
 - Includes detailed capcode and city names database created from data on https://www.tomzulu10capcodes.nl and http://p2000.bommel.net
 - Code to guess and complete as much address data as possible
 - Geocode functionality using https://opencagedata.com to get rough lat/long location and maps links, fetched data is stored for future use.


## Installation
The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in comparison to installing any other add-on.

1. Add my add-ons repository to your home assistant instance  
   (in supervisor addons store at top right, or click button below if you have configured my HA)  
   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcyberjunky%2Faddon-p2000_rtlsdr)
1. Install this add-on.
1. Click the `Save` button to store your configuration.
1. Set the add-on options to your preferences (see documentation tab after installation)
1. Start the add-on.
1. Check the logs of the add-on to see if everything went well.


Make sure your RTL-SDR dongle is inserted in the Home assistant device.  
Place your antenna in a good location near the window, or even outside.

If you don't see the wanted result, consider setting verbosity to 'debug' and restart.  
Don't leave verbosity debug enabled for a long time, since it logs a lot of data, and can wear out your storage devices.
